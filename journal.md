Time to get started!!
Like the previous project I did for Highway, I will be using 6V 300rpm JGB37-520 Motors, as well as an Arduino Mega and Nrf24l01.

This project, I am planning on making a bot which can play the soccer 2024/25 game for Mechmania, a regional robotics competition that may be a little hard to find online. The game consists of collecting and scoring balls by pushing them into a lowered net or a raised net. I intend to make a mecanum wheel drivetrain with two distinct mechanisms; Intake, which grabs balls off the ground and stores it in the robot, and a servo-controlled arm which grabs them and raises them onto the highest scoring platform.


To start, I CADded out a small drivetrain.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that my 3D printer can only print 250mm by 210mm, I had to split the drivetrain into two distinct pieces, 240mm by 150mm. The end frame is 240m by 300mm, and has a slight rectangular design, although the wheel placements are about square.

I also couldn't find a suitable 60mm Mecanum wheel reference model which matched the specs of the ones I'm looking at for this project, so I made some grey cylinders for testing purposes.
